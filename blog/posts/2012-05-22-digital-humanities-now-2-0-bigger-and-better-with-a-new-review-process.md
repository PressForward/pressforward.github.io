After five months of retooling, we’re relaunching *[Digital Humanities Now](http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org "Digital Humanities Now")* today. As part of this relaunch it has been moved into the [PressForward](http://pressforward.org/ "PressForward") family of publications, as one of that project’s new models of how high-quality work can emerge from, and reach, scholarly communities.

The first iteration of *DH Now*, which we launched [two years ago](http://www.dancohen.org/2009/11/18/introducing-digital-humanities-now/), relied almost entirely on an automated process to find what digital humanities scholars were talking about and linking to (namely, on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/)). About a year ago, in an attempt to make the signal-to-noise ratio a bit better, I took my slightly tongue-in-cheek “Editor-in-Chief” role more seriously, vetting each potential item for inclusion and adding better titles and “abstracts.”

Today we take a much larger step forward, in an attempt to find and highlight the best work in digital humanities, and curate it in such a way as to be maximally useful to the scholarly community. The *DH Now* team, including [Joan Fragaszy Troyano](http://chnm.gmu.edu/staff/joan-troyano/), [Sasha Hoffman](http://twitter.com/SashaCA2), and [Jeri Wieringa](http://twitter.com/jeriwieringa), have corralled a large array of digital humanities content into the base for the publication. Building on a Digital Humanities Registry I set up in the summer, they have located and are now tracking the content streams of hundreds of scholars and institutions (what we’re calling the [Compendium of Digital Humanities](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en_US&hl=en_US&key=0AucqXAIBhf_idGNlZzVjSGkxQU9XNU4yb0w1clMxeXc&single=true&gid=3&output=html)), from which we can select items for highlighting in the “news” and “Editors’ Choice” columns on the site. As before, social media (including Twitter) and other means for assessing the resonance of scholarly works will serve a role, but not an exclusive one, as we seek out new and important work wherever that work may be found.

The foundation of the editorial model, [as I explained in this space on the launch of PressForward](http://www.dancohen.org/2011/06/22/introducing-pressforward/), is that instead of a traditional process of submission to a journal that leads to a binary acceptance/rejection decision many months later (and publication many more months or years later), we can begin to think of scholarly communication as a process that begins with open publication on the web and that leads to successive layers of review. Contrary to the [concerns of critics](http://theaporetic.com/?p=2776), this is far from a stream of unvetted work.

Imagine a pyramid of scholarship. At the bottom is a broad base of scholarship on the open web (which understandably worries many scholars who object to new models of scholarly communication that do not rely on the decisive eye of a paid editor and the scarcity of journal pages). From that base, however, a minority of scholarly works seem worthy of additional attention, and after word of mouth and dissemination of those potentially important pieces, more scholars weigh in, making a work rise or fall. As we move up the pyramid—to more exclusive forms of “publication,” fewer and fewer works survive. Far from lacking peer review, the model we are proposing involves significant winnowing as a scholarly work passes through various levels of review.

For the new DH Now, these levels of publication are transparent on the site, and can be subscribed to individually depending on how unfiltered or filtered scholars would like their stream to be:

• Most people will likely want to subscribe to the [main *DHNow* feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/DHNowEditorsChoiceAndNews), which will include the Editors’ Choice articles as well as important news items such as jobs, resources, and conferences.

• Those who want full access to the wide base of the scholarly pyramid (or who don’t trust the editorial board’s decisions) can subscribe to the [unfiltered Compendium of Digital Humanities](http://feeds.feedburner.com/DHNowUnfiltered), which includes feeds from hundreds of scholars.

• For those who felt that the original *DH Now* worked well for them, we have maintained a [“top tweeted stories” feed](http://tweetedtimes.com/dhnow).

• Finally, a major new addition is the launch of a quarterly review of the best of the best—the top of the pyramid of review, which will likely contain less than 1% of works that begin at the base. We will notify scholars about potential inclusion, and pass along comments and suggestions for improvement before publication. We hope and expect that inclusion in this journal form of DH Now will be worthy of inclusion on CVs, in promotion and tenure decisions, and other areas helpful to digital humanities scholars. DH Now will have an ISSN, an editorial board, and all of the other signifiers of quality and peer review that individuals and institutions expect.

You can read more about our process on *DH Now‘s* “[How This Works](http://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/how-this-works/)” page.

We believe this new format has several critical benefits. First, it democratizes scholarly communication in a helpful way. Over the last two years, for instance, DH Now has highlighted up-and-coming work by promising graduate students simply because they chose to post their ideas to a new blog or institutional website. Second, it democratizes the editorial process while still taking into account the scarcity of attention and without sacrificing quality. Although we have a managing group of editors here at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media, we are accounting for the views and criticisms of a much broader circle of scholars to make decisions about inclusion and exclusion, and those decisions themselves can be reviewed. Third, DH Now broadens the definition of what scholarship is, by highlighting forms beyond the traditional article. Finally, it encourages open access publishing, which we think has an ethical benefit as well as a reputational benefit to the scholars who post their work online.
