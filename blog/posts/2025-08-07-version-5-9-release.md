We are pleased to announce the release of [version 5.9 of the PressForward plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pressforward/). 
---

Version 5.9 of the PressForward plugin includes several important new features. First users may now target Mastadon, Bluesky, and Threads to amplify their PressForward posts. Second, users can now subscribe to Google Scholar keyword and author URLs using the same process as they do subscribe to RSS feeds. This new source of information reflects the diversification of dissemination of scholarship, and is the first in a number of new features to better reflect the current media landscpace. Finally, users can now have more control over whether or not tags are imported when a source item is nominated.

As usual, the version included optimizations of current features and a small mumber of bug fixes.
