We are pleased to announce the release of [version 5.6 of the PressForward plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pressforward/). 

Over the past year, Boone Gorges, of [HardG](https://hardg.com/about/) has been diligently working to get PressForward in to tip-top condition for our users. The system is now optimized to work integrate more fully with the native functions provided by the latest versions of WordPress. This release includes improved integration with WordPress's block editor system, as well as a number of under-the-covers redesigns to improve feed importing performance. 

Version 5.6 builds on the two previous releases that have included extensive refactoring of the Reader interface, the Nominate This system, and cleared away a list of accumulated bugs. In upcoming versions, users can look for improved user messaging, and configurable email notifications to support the editorial workflows. 

As always, we are eager to hear from our users about the features you want to see in PressForward. Leave us an idea or a feature request in our [discussions area on Github](https://github.com/PressForward/pressforward/discussions/1178).
