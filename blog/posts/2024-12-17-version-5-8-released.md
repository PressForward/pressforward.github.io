We are pleased to announce the release of [version 5.8 of the PressForward plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pressforward/). 
---

Version 5.8 of the PressForward plugin includes a new opt-in feature submits a source URL to the Internet Archive (archive.org) when an item is promoted to draft. We view this feature as contributing to efforts to preserve content that editors view as significant. 

Second, this version includes overhauls of a number of long-standing features. The Feed management panel now includes the Block Editor, fields for editing a feed URL, and tools for manually triggering retrieval. The Add Feed tools now include improved validation for URLs, duplicate detection, and better auto-detection of feed URLs based on site URLs. The PressForward Dashboard has a new menu structure. Feeds are now handled in a separate top-level menu item, while ‘All Content’ is renamed to ‘Feed Items’ and ‘Nominated’ is renamed to ‘Nominated Items’. We also have added support for feed authors, which are pulled from the feed, are editable by the admin, and are used as a fallback value for feed item authors when a given feed item has no specific author data. 

Finally, these features are joined by performance improvements to the Reader interfaces, and standardize behavior of the Nominate/Nominate Count interfaces in Reader. We also have a new tool allows filtering by date in Reader interfaces.
