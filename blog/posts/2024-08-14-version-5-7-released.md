We are pleased to announce the release of [version 5.7 of the PressForward plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pressforward/). 
---

This version includes a number of new features, including a “Welcome” panel that provides an easy-to-use path into PressForward content for both new and existing users. We have also added the ability to add a comment when nominating an item; a feature that allows admins to customize the format the ‘Source’ statement appended to incoming items; and  configurable email notifications when an item you’ve nominated or commented on receives a new editorial comment.

We have also made a number of enhancements to existing features and functionality. For instance, we have improved the consistency in appearance and markup in various admin panels, the performance of the debugger panel, and to the Stats panel, including admin-configurable access control for Stats. Finally, we have fixed a number of bugs in the way that some admin panel subnavigation links are built, allowing for better deep linking within these panels.

We hope you enjoy working with this version.
